# Memento

_**Memento** allows making snapshots of an objectâ€™s state and restoring it in future._

## `conceptual.rs`

This is a conceptual example of Memento pattern. Keep in mind, that saving and restoring objects can be done via `serde` framework, see an example below.

### How to Run

```bash
cargo run --bin memento
```

### Output

```
Originator backup: '1'
Originator backup: '2'
Restored to state: 2
Restored to state: 1
```

## `serde.rs`

A common way to make a structure serializable is to derive `Serialize` and
`Deserialize` traits from `serde` crate. Then an object of serializable type
can be converted to many different formats, e.g. JSON with `serde_json` crate.

```rust
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Originator {
    state: u32,
}
```

### How to Run

```bash
cargo run --bin memento-serde
```

### Output

```
{"state":1}
{"state":2}
Restored to state: 2
Restored to state: 1
```
